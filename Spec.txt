1. We need to get rid of the sequences that has either a deletion, insertion, or both

2. The final output file needs to have the following: Reads, Pct, Target, and label of what mutations were introduced

3. Sequences at 10 Reads or below needs to be removed in the output file as well


IMPROVEMENTS

1. Get rid of sample ID, not needed, we can maybe place a new identifier instead (not sure what)

2. Recalculate the PCT based on a new total (new total will now be the total reads of all variants present in the new output)

3. Place mutations in one cell block (in an increasing order of mutation position), 
   instead of multiple cells, allowing setting of filter conditions easier

4. Provide a different output of what sequences were culled from the original sheet 
   to do a sanity check ensuring only the weird sequences were removed
